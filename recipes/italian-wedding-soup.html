    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        A beautiful recipe from my co-works wedding. We didn't have this soup but I did get it afterwards from Swiss Chalet.
        It contains a rich broth mixed with some meatballs, spinach, and pasta. Perfect for a cold winters night or, it can be made for a light summer evening.
