    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 bound Italian sausage</li>
        <li>0.5 cup warm water</li>
        <li>1 cup sliced black olives</li>
        <li>1 pinch basil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1.5 teaspoon dried sage</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried onion flakes</li>
        <li>2 jars marinara sauce</li>
        <li>1 pack of lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>8 ounces of ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 pound mozzarella cheese, shredded</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Brown the beef and Italian sausage in a large skillet over medium-high heat. <br> 
            Drain excess grease. Stir in the water and black olives, and season with basil, garlic powder, oregano, sage, pepper, minced garlic, and onion flakes. <br>
            Simmer for 15 minutes, stirring frequently. Stir in marinara sauce, and remove from heat.
        </li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees.</li>
        <li>
            Place a layer of the meat and sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 baking dish. Cover with a layer of dry noodles. <br>
            Spread a thin layer of ricotta cheese over the noodles, and sprinkle with a little mozzarella cheese. Cover with a layer of sauce, and repeat <br>
            layering ending with the meat and sauce on top. Reserve about 0.5 cups of mozzarella cheese for later.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake for 45 minutes in the oven, but check after 30 mintues depending on how thick the lasagna is. Lasagna is cooked <br>
            when you can easily stick a knife into it. Sprinkle the reserved cheese over the top, and return to the oven for about 10 minutes <br>
            for a nice melted cheese topping.
